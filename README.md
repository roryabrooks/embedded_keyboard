# Introduction
The synthesizer developed is able to process up to 10 key presses simultaneously, alter note frequencies via vibrato, generate different waveforms, and tile with automatic octave assignment to form a larger keyboard (up to 7 keyboards can be connected). The synthesizer also has a "looping" playback feature, whereby by holding down the leftmost knob, a player can play a tune, and upon releasing, the keys played during this period will be replayed automatically to form a more complex tune.
